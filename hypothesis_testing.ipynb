    "3. Choose the Significance level (a), which is the propability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true\n",

    "3. Bounce Rate: There's no statistically significant difference in Bounce Rates between the themes (P-Value=0.230)\n",

For the other key performance indicators like Conversion Rate, Bounce Rate, and Scroll Depth, the choice between a Light Theme and a Dark Theme does not significatly affect user behaviour according to the data provided"
